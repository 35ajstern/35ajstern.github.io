\section{EDUCATION}  
{\bf Ph.D. Computational Biology}\hfill 2015 - present\\
{\sl UC Berkeley}\\
Advised by Prof. Rasmus Nielsen, Depts. of Statistics \& Integrative Biology.\\
Dissertation committee: Rasmus Nielsen, Yun S. Song, Priya Moorjani, Ian J. Wang

{\bf B.Sc. Engineering}\hfill 2011 - 2015\\
{\sl Northwestern University}\\
Advised by Prof. Luis Amaral, Dept. of Chemical \& Biological Engineering

\section{TEACHING EXPERIENCE}
 Stat 135 {\sl Concepts of Statistics}  \hfill Fall 2018\\
UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA\\
\begin{itemize}
\item[] Led discussion sections and held office hours. The course, taught by Adam Lucas, surveys the theory and practice (using R) of applied statistics, aimed at an audience of junior/senior statistics majors. 
\item[] Received Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor award (awarded to $\sim$9\% of GSIs)
\end{itemize} 

\section{WORK EXPERIENCE}
{\sl Computational Biology Fellow} \hfill June 2017 - Sept 2017, March 2018 - July 2018 \\
AncestryDNA, San Francisco, CA
\begin{itemize}
\item[] Developed methods and visualization tools to explore the recent demographic history of fine-scale human communities. I also worked on statistical methods for relationship and pedigree inference. 
\end{itemize} 

{\sl Research Intern} \hfill Sept 2014 - June 2015 \\
Amaral Lab, Northwestern University
\begin{itemize}
\item[] I studied variation in the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, a short translational motif widespread in bacteria yet uncharacterized for all but a small number of species. I developed statistical methods for quantifying SD usage. I applied these methods to show a novel correlation between SD usage and species growth rate and doubling time.
\end{itemize} 

{\sl Research \& Development Intern} \hfill June 2014 - November 2014\\
BigDataBio, LLC, Cambridge, MA
\begin{itemize}
\item[] Deployed and wrote documentation for a visualization software pipeline to take .VCF and visualize the sample’s variants and their implications in disease.
\end{itemize} 


\section{SKILLS} 

{\sl Programming languages:} Python, UNIX, \LaTeX\\
{\sl Selected courses:} Statistical Learning Theory, Applied Probability, Applied Statistics, Theoretical Statistics, Targeted Learning, Information Theory, Real Analysis, Parallel Programming, Protein Structure \& Function, Population Genetics

{\sl Team Leader}
\begin{itemize}
\item[] STEM enrichment for elementary school students in local Title I schools. I design and lead interactive sci- entific demonstrations relating to natural selection and speciation
\end{itemize} 
Be A Scientist \hfill Sept 2015 - present\\
{\sl Volunteer}
\begin{itemize}
\item[] STEM mentorship for 7th-graders in a local Title I public school. I guide a small group of students in designing, deploying, and interpreting their own scientific experiments
\end{itemize} 
UC Berkeley Center for Computational Biology \hfill Sept 2015 - present\\
{\sl Volunteer}
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Organized guest faculty speaker series (2016-17) with equal gender representation

\end{itemize}
Summerbridge SF \hfill 2008 - 2011\\
{\sl Volunteer tutor}
\begin{itemize}
\item[] Mentored and tutored lower-income middle school students in mathematics through a tuition-free academic enrichment program.
\end{itemize}
