### <u>Inferring selection frequency trajectories using ARGs</u>
Most current methods for detecting natural selection from DNA sequence data do not make full use of the information available in DNA sequence data. We developed a new technique for approximating the full likelihood function for the selection coefficient, which can be used for detecting selection, estimating selection coefficients, and for inferring the allele frequency trajectory of a selected or neutral allele. We used the method to infer the past allele frequency trajectory for a lactase persistence SNP (<i>MCM6</i>) , as well as a set of 11 pigmentation-associated variants in Europeans. Several genes showed evidence of strong selection particularly within the last 5,000 years, including <i>ASIP</i>, <i>KITLG</i>, and <i>TYR</i>. However, selection on <i>OCA2/HERC2</i> seems to be much older and, in contrast to previous claims, we find no evidence of selection on <i>TYRP1</i>. (Available on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/592675">bioRxiv</a>, Submitted to <i>PLoS Genetics</i>)

### <u>In progress</u>
Other projects I am working on include: the interaction between mutational load and adaptation, and implications for <b>genetic rescue</b>; reconstructing <b>selection on polygenic traits</b>; inferring heritability and polygenic selection in <b>structured populations</b>.
