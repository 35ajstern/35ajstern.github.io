#### About me

I'm a member of the Bioinformatics & Data Science team at <a href="https://grail.com/">GRAIL</a>. My background is in statistical & population genetics. In 2020, I received my PhD in <a href="https://ccb.berkeley.edu/academics/phd-in-computational-biology/">Computational Biology</a> at UC Berkeley, advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PySbfcEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Rasmus Nielsen</a>, also worked closely with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SPXgieEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Noah Zaitlen</a> at UCLA.

#### Research interests

I'm interested in variation and evolution of heritable traits; in particular, how adaptation and natural selection have shaped complex trait and disease variation in modern humans. My focus is on building methods that use DNA sequence data and/or genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to study complex trait architecture, evolution, and adaptation.  

Some of my specific research interests are:
<ul>
	<li> Detecting natural selection, from alleles to complex traits </li>
	<li> Disentangling selection on pleiotropically-related traits </li> 
	<li> The role of ancestry in heritable trait variation </li>
	<li> Using ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) to detect selection </li>
</ul>

#### Background

I did my undergraduate studies at Northwestern University, where I worked with <a href="https://adamhockenberry.com/">Adam Hockenberry</a> and <a href="https://amaral.northwestern.edu/">Lu√≠s Amaral</a> at the Northwestern Institute for Complex Systems. From 2017-2018 I was a Computational Biology Fellow at AncestryDNA, working with <a href="http://songsy.github.io/">Shiya Song</a> and Dan Garrigan, where I developed statistical models for inferring genealogical relationships from genetic data, and studied the recent demographic history of humans in North America.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking (especially the Sierras), playing/following basketball/the NBA, cooking, and watching The Sopranos.
