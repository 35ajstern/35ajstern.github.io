I am a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley in the <a href="https://ccb.berkeley.edu/academics/phd-in-computational-biology/">Graduate Group in Computational Biology</a> advised by <a href="http://www.nielsenlab.org/">Rasmus Nielsen</a> of the Depts. of Integrative Biology and Statistics. 

My current research interests are in theoretical population genetics with a focus on modeling the genomic signatures of selection and complex trait evolution. I'm especially interested in applying these models to determine which parts of the genome have evolved under selection. I am also interested in the interplay of population structure and selection. 

#### Background
I did my undergraduate studies at Northwestern University, where I worked with Adam Hockenberry and <a href="https://amaral.northwestern.edu/">Lu√≠s Amaral</a> at the Northwestern Institute for Complex Systems. In 2017-2018 I was a Computational Biology Fellow at AncestryDNA, where I worked with Shiya Song and Dan Garrigan, studying the recent demographic history of humans in North America using both genetic and genealogical data.
