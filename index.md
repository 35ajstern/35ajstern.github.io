I am a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley in the <a href="https://ccb.berkeley.edu/academics/phd-in-computational-biology/">Graduate Group in Computational Biology</a> advised by <a href="http://www.nielsenlab.org/">Rasmus Nielsen</a> of the Depts. of Integrative Biology and Statistics. I also work with <a href="http://zaitlenlab.science/">Noah Zaitlen</a> at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine. 

I'm interested in studying the evolution of complex traits -- in particular, how adaptation and natural selection have shaped who we are today: i.e., modern human phenotypic and genetic variation. My work draws on a combination of population and statistical genetics, and is broadly focused on using DNA sequence data and/or GWAS to build methods to study adaptation and complex trait evolution.  

Some of my specific research interests are:
<ol>
	<li> Detecting natural selection, from alleles to complex traits </li>
	<li> Disentangling selection on pleiotropically-related traits </li> 
	<li> Modeling stratification in human GWAS and downstream analyses </li>
</ol>

#### Background
I did my undergraduate studies at Northwestern University, where I worked with <a href="https://adamhockenberry.com/">Adam Hockenberry</a> and <a href="https://amaral.northwestern.edu/">Lu√≠s Amaral</a> at the Northwestern Institute for Complex Systems. From 2017-2018 I was a Computational Biology Fellow at AncestryDNA, where I worked with <a href="http://songsy.github.io/">Shiya Song</a> and Dan Garrigan, studying the recent demographic history of humans in North America using both genetic and genealogical data.
